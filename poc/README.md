# POC

The Proof Of Concept contains the following modules:

* commons - code containing code that is common for all cloud/standalone approaches.
It contains for instance the command line utils meant to be used by the administrator or 
general platform independent behaviour of the client

* standalone - the standalone server, client and administrator application

* gcp - the admin application, the client application as well as GCP deployable content supporting the
Google Cloud implementation
